# PathFinder Game
**Reinforcement Learning Maze Runner**

Hello Reader! I want this project to serve as a platform for simulation-based reinforcement learning. In other words, this repository should be a platform for studying how actors can learn to overcome challenges without explicit instructions. 


_How does this project approach complex learning?_

An actor that can optimize its own "path" from Point A to Point B is undoubtedly useful. Machines that can take sensor input and develop idealized solutions to problems will find themselves replacing human actors in many career fields. Until recently, machine-based automation was limited to simple, repetitive tasks; programming involved series of "if-then" conditions. As our computing resources advance, we are refining mathematics with the understanding that we can realize significantly more complex methods of automation.

Such mathematics emphasize the importance of dynamic input from complex environments.  

This project will host lightweight simulation environments so that a user can experiment with reinforcement learning (RL) schemas under minimal load. 

_What happens after the framework is established?_

After the PathFinder framework is viable, I will develop various simulations to experiment with various RL schemas. As experiments continue, I will update the PathFinder repository to accommodate increasingly complex simulations that better replicate real-world stimulus.

_Overall, what can I expect to find in this repository?_

- PathFinder schema
  - Emphasizes actors finding their way through two-dimensional environments given a variety of stimulus and challenges
- PathFinder-based experiments
  - Single-actor maze games
  - Multi-actor communication challenges
  - Adversarial "capture-the-flag" games
- PathFinder GUI (optional)
  - For visualizing/playing games using the same parameters as a machine-actor

### Project Status

Right now, I'm currently doing basic functionality tests on the parameters in the mazes. I need to ensure that the maze "physics" don't allow players to execute unexpected behavior (walking through walls, exiting the maze, etc.).

### Goals

- ~~Create maze environment~~
- ~~Create players~~
- Create self training schema (without visualization)
- Create GUI for human play
